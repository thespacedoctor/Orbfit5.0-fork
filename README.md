# Orbfit v5.0.5 Fork

This is a 'fork' of the [Orbfit code found here](http://adams.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/). At the time I forked the code it was at v5.0.5.

The main contribution I've made is to craft an new executable called `ephem` that will generate an ephemeris for a single object, at a single epoch given a specific observatory code. The code can be found in `/src/orbfit/ephem.f90`
